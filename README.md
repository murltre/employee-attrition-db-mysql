# employee-attrition-db-mysql

## Project Summary
This project involved designing a normalized relational database in MySQL Workbench to analyze employee attrition using IBMâ€™s HR dataset (sourced from Kaggle). 

After acquiring the raw dataset, I performed data cleaning and transformation to ensure compatibility with a relational model, then applied database normalization principles (3NF) to eliminate redundancies and improve query efficiency. The finalized schema was then loaded to MySQL Workbench. 

Finally, I wrote analytical SQL queries to address key business questions (e.g., attrition trends by education level, job role satisfaction correlations). The project demonstrates end-to-end competency in database design, ETL processes, and data-driven decision-making.



A **3NF-compliant MySQL database** designed to analyze IBM HR data and identify factors influencing employee attrition.  

## Key Features  
- **Normalized relational schema** (designed in MySQL Workbench).  
- **1,470+ employee records** loaded across 10+ tables.  
- **Sample SQL queries** for attrition analysis (e.g., job role vs. distance from home).  

## ðŸ› Tools Used  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Modeling**: MySQL Workbench (ERD forward-engineered to SQL).  
- **Data Source**: [IBM HR Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset).
